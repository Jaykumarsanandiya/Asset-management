    <div class="intro">
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p> Fixed Deposit is a good investment.As an investment instrument offered by banks and NBFCs (non-banking financial companies), Fixed Deposit is a great way to grow your savings with utmost safety. It is one of the most preferred avenues that enables you to deposit a lump sum amount with your financier, and choose a tenor as per your convenience. On completion of the pre-decided tenor, your deposit starts earning an interest, throughout the chosen duration, as per the interest rate at which you locked in your deposit. 
        </p>
        <h3>
            Why should you invest in Fixed Deposit ? 
        </h3>
        <p>
           The benefits of investing in Fixed Deposit are numerous. It is risk-free and guarantees fixed returns. Fixed deposit interest rates are higher than other risk-free investment instruments like Treasury Bills or Government Bonds. Fixed deposits provide complete flexibility with regard to the tenure of investment. The term of fixed deposits can vary between 7 days to 10 years. 
        </p>

        <h3> How diversified should your Fixed Deposit portfolio be? </h3>
        <p>It’s wise to diversify your investment portfolio, and an FD is an investment option that has been looked upon favourably for several generations. This is because of the stability and security FDs offer. With competitive interest rates of up to 7.25%, Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit is a great option.Additionally, FDs have several other benefits in addition to safety of investment and fixed returns. You can also avail loans against them during a financial emergency. Invest in a Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit to grow your savings easily, and reap the benefits of high interest rates with flexibility.</p>

        <h3>Fate of investments above Rs.1 lakh</h3>
        <p>
            Your FD investments above Rs.1 lakh in a single bank may not be entirely safe because the cap on deposit insurance is Rs. 1 lakh. So, even if you have FDs in multiple branches of the same bank, all your deposits are totaled and capped at Rs. 1 lakh for insurance purpose. However, there’s a way around this. You can invest and get cover for more than Rs.1 lakh on your FDs if you open them at different banks. In such cases, the deposit insurance applied for each bank will be separate.</p>

    <div class="intro risk">
        <h1>Risk</h1>
        <p>The interest rates are subject to change at regular intervals of time. The fixed deposits offered by banks carry the risk of being locked in for a long interval of time at lower interest rates. Thus they will yield a low rate of return.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="intro liquidity ">
        <h3>liquidity</h3>
        <p>Bank FDs can be easily liquidated, I.e. one can break his/her FD prior to the maturity date. However, a penalty may be levied and the penalty amount varies from one bank to another. In case of tax-saving FDs, a variation of FD, you can withdraw before the completion of the 5-year tenure.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tax intro">
        <h1>Taxation</h1>
        <p>The bank estimates your interest income for the year from all the FDs you have with the bank. There would be a 10% TDS deduction if your interest income exceeds Rs 40,000 (Rs 50,000 in the case of senior citizens).</p>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <div class="Return intro">
        <h1>Return</h1>
        <p>Return on investment (ROI) is a measurement of how much money or profit is made on an investment as a percentage of its cost. Fixed deposits are a safe way of protecting and growing your wealth. While most banks offer interest rates between 6% to 7%, company fixed deposits usually offer higher interest rates. One such offering is the Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit that offers an attractive rate of interest. With numerous benefits, Bajaj Finance offers the best investment avenue for your hard-earned money. Here are some of the key benefits you stand to gain from.</p>
