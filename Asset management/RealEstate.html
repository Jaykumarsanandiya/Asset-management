        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p> Real Estate is a good investment.Real estate investing involves the purchase, ownership, management, rental and/or sale of real estate for profit. Improvement of realty property as part of a real estate investment strategy is generally considered to be a sub-specialty of real estate investing called real estate development. 
        </p>
        <h3>
            Why should you invest in Real Estate ? 
        </h3>
        <p>
           The benefits of investing in real estate are numerous. With well-chosen assets, investors can enjoy predictable cash flow, excellent returns, tax advantages, and diversification—and it's possible to leverage real estate to build wealth.

            Thinking about investing in real estate? Here's what you need to know about real estate benefits and why real estate is considered a good investment. 
        </p>

        <h3> How diversified should your Real Estate portfolio be? </h3>
        <p>Investors who diversify don’t want to put all their eggs in one basket. They try to balance risk and reward by spreading out their investments across multiple property types or locations. Investors who specialize, on the other hand, focus on buying the same property type repeatedly. They attempt to replicate what is successful, without spreading themselves too thin.</p>

        <h3>Real Estate as a Dividend-Paying Asset</h3>
        <p>Property dividends have monetary value even though they are considered a non-monetary type of dividend. An in-kind dividend like a property dividend can be advantageous for investors who may be looking to reduce or defer taxes, as they can keep the property held for a period of time without liquidating the asset.</p>

    <div class="intro risk">
        <h1>Risk</h1>
        <p>In private equity real estate, the fact that we buy physical properties gives many investors a level of comfort. Yet there are many risks involved in commercial real estate investing that have to be considered in conjunction with the expected value of the investment. Having frames of reference for investors to quantify risk helps ensure that the investment matches their needs, goals and tolerance. At Origin, we use sophisticated risk models and the deep knowledge of our acquisition team spread over eleven markets to account for the many variables involved in evaluating the potential returns of a new property.

    <div class="intro liquidity ">
        <h3>liquidity</h3>
        <p>Liquidity in Real Estate is all about how easily an asset can be converted into cash in the market. In simple terms, it can be defined as the ability to sell the asset or property at a fair price within a fixed period of time. Liquidity risk can be stated as the difficulty in selling the investments when desired.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tax intro">
        <h1>Taxation</h1>
        <p>Under this section you can claim tax benefits on the repayment of the principal amount. You can claim deductions on investments made in the return of income. The income should be for the year in which the investment was made. The maximum tax saving limit is Rs 1.5 lakh.</p>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <div class="Return intro">
        <h1>Return</h1>
        <p>Return on investment (ROI) is a measurement of how much money or profit is made on an investment as a percentage of its cost. Since this metric shows how well your investment dollars are being used, it pays to know both what ROI is and how to calculate ROI in real estate.</p>

        Different Types of Real Estate Investments are discussed below –

        <h3> 1. Residential </h3>

        <p>Residential structures are properties such as houses, apartment buildings, townhouses, and vacation houses where a person or family pays you to live in the property. The length of their stay is based upon the rental or lease agreement. Most residential leases are on a twelve-month basis in the United States.</p>

        <h3> 2. Commercial</h3>
        <p> Commercial properties consist mostly of office buildings and skyscrapers. If you were to take some of your savings and construct a small building with individual offices, you could lease them out to companies and small business owners, who would pay you rent to use the property.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Industrial</h3>
        <p> Industrial real estate consists of everything from industrial warehouses, storage units, car washes, or other special purposes real estate that generate sales from customers who use the facility.
